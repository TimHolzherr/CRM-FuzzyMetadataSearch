# CRM-FuzzyMetadataSearch
FuzzyMetadataSearch is a Dynamics CRM 2016 Plugin which adds a "fuzzy" search to the CRM. 
This search is inspired by Sublimetext "Search For Everything" and is an alternative to the solution explorer.
The CRM solution explorer is slow, especially for bigger solutions. 
Accessing a distinct attribute of a entity over the solution explorer takes up to 5 seconds or more. 
This is where the FuzzyMetadataSearch comes into play. 
By simply typing a part of the entity and attribute name the fuzzy search finds your attribute for you and opens the CRM configuration page for this attribute.

In a first step the FuzzyMetadataSearch will only return attributes, later all accessible configuration of the solution explorer will be included. E.g. views, masks, etc.
